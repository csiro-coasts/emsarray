* Fix transect plot title and units.
  All attributes were being dropped accidentally in `prepare_data_array_for_transect()`.
  (:pr:`114`).
* Add `coast` and `gridlines` parameters to :func:`emsarray.plot.plot_on_figure()`,
  allowing users to disable these components of a plot.
  Currently gridlines can cause issues in interactive Jupyter notebooks
  and some other environments.
  There is no one solution to every situation.
  Allowing users to disable gridlines is a temporary work around
  while other solutions are being sought.
